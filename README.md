Welcome to the Svelte4 Project Template!

If you are looking to begin a pure SvelteJS project, without SvelteKit, and want to incorporate various tools such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, TailwindCSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer, this is the perfect starting point.

While the official SvelteJS documentation provides instructions to begin a project, it does not include guidelines to integrate TailwindCSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer.

This project template was created by adhering to the official documentation and utilizing best practices to incorporate TailwindCSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer. By simply cloning the repository, installing the dependencies using npm, and running the command 'npm run dev', you can begin your new project.

Please follow the detailed steps below to get started:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/multics/svelte4-project-template.git my-project

# 2. (Optional) Disconnect your project from this repository
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <your repository location>

# 3. Begin your work
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's all there is to it!

P.S. This project template works best with Visual Studio Code.
